# Integrate Blazor Mention Component with Rich Text Editor
Blazor Rich Text Editor allows users to easily integrate our `Blazor Mention component` to display a suggestion list of items that users can select or tag. When the user types the `@` character in the editor, the suggestion list will appear, and the user can select or tag a value from it. This can be a useful feature for applications that need to support tagging or mentioning other users or items within the content being edited.
